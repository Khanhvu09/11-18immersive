# # Variables
# # - strings, letters, numbers, or any other stuff
# # you can make with a keyboard
# # a variable is just a fast way to refer to something else 
# # variables do not make the program faster.
# # They make the program slower!
# # Variables make it easier for us to write programs.

# # Data Types 
# # - Programming languages see different types of variables differently
# # - string - English stuff.
# # - Number - I think you know what this is. Something with numbers 
# # Floats, integers 
# # -- float = it has a . (decimal) in it 
# # -- integer = has no . (decimal) in it 
# # - Booleans = true or false, on or off, 1 or 0, yes or no, right or left 
# # - list - list of things. a signle variable with a bunch of parts 
# # - Dictonaries - variable of variables 
# # - Objects - super dictionaries 

# # Primitive Data types = string, number, boolean 
# month = "November";
# print type(month)
# date = 13
# print type(date)
# dateAsFloat = 13.0
# print type(dateAsFloat)
# aBool = True
# print type(aBool)
# aList = []
# print type(aList)
# aDictionary = {}
# print type(aDictionary)

# # concatenate is programming speak for add things together 
# first = "Khanh" 
# last = "Vu"
# fullName = first + last 
# fullName = first + " " + last
# print fullName

# fourteen = 10 + 4
# print fourteen
# fourteen = "10" + "4"
# print fourteen
# # fourteen = 10 + "4" (wont work)

# # cast = change a variable to a new data type 
# fourteen = int("10") + 4 

# Math = +. -, *, % 
# print 2 + 2
# print 2 - 2
# print 2 / 2
# print 2 * 2
# # % = modulus. Divides the number and gives you the remainder 
# print 2 % 2 
# print 2 % 3
# print 2 ** 3
# print "-" * 20 
# A string and a * and a number = give me X strings

# Python does not have an simple incrementer 
# num = 1;
# num++ 
# num += 1
# C
